# Meaw Pet Feeder: Firmware

## Introduction

This project implements the firmware for an ESP32-based pet feeding device, where the user can schedule the times at which food portions need to be served. <br>
The device works together with a Mobile App, through which it can also be controlled. <br>
**Make sure to to also visit the App respository:** [Meaw-PetFeeder-App](https://github.com/MatheusCavini/MeawApp)

The project was created as part of the discipline "Embedded Systems" (PMR3402) for my Mechatronics Engineering course at Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo (USP).
